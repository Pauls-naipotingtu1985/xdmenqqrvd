So I just walked out of Pabrik Gula and my brain feels like it’s still tumbling around in a washing machine. You know, the ones with the synth noises as if it's confused about being a washing machine or a DJ. Anyway, the movie — or was it an abstract painting? — is like a sugar rush at 3 AM, when you're all jittery and your eyes are blinking open-close-open like a broken neon sign.

This weeeird scene where the factory machines looked almost alive, like they had tiny sugar hearts beating inside 'em, made me spill the popcorn, I swear. And the smell of popcorn — ugh, I might never get it out of this jacket. Note to self: theaters = popcorn graveyards. And my back is aching like I was cast as an extra in a medieval torture scene. Meanwhile, the main character was walking in slow motion — or was that just my over-popped brain slowing it down? — through this jungle of pipes and those whale-sized gears creaking like grandma’s rocking chair.

> There was that moment, kinda felt like a Wes Anderson flick but more chaotic and with sugar dust. Like if Willy Wonka and a mad scientist decided to collaborate on a Dali painting. The characters seemed dusted with powdered sugar, or was it just the weird theater lighting?

Man, the theater was so noisy, can’t tell if the whispers were from the movie or someone’s secret whispered debate on downloading the movie instead of, you know, watch the movie normally. Those whispers blend with the sound of—what, a sugar cube avalanche?—and created this sweet chaos. It felt almost...fizzing, like a soda pop for your brain.

Someone, a character or maybe the director whispering through the script, tried to wrestle control from the monotony of a factory and paint life’s poetic unpredictability with every sugar-crusted frame. Maybe I’m just sugared up but it all felt so beautifully confusing.

Was that ketchup on the floor? Or a melted cherry candy? That’s a mystery for another dazzle addled day.

```javascript
function sweetDreams(factory) {
    factory.machines.forEach(machine => {
        machine.synchronize((sugar, rush) => {
            return tasteBudRevolution(sugar, rush);
        });
    });
}
```
